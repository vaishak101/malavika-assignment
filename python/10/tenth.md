Brief Interpretation of Results
MSE and RMSE:
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) provides the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. A lower MSE indicates a better fit.
The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of the MSE and gives a measure of how far predictions deviate from actual values in the same units as the target variable (in this case, the value of homes).
If you get an RMSE of, for example, around 4, it indicates that, on average, your model's predictions deviate from the actual median home values by about $4,000.

Interpretation of Results
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 24.29

The MSE of 24.29 represents the average of the squares of the errors (the differences between predicted and actual values). In this context, it indicates that the model's predictions deviate from the actual median home values by an average of about 24.29 squared units (where the units are in thousands of dollars).
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 4.93

The RMSE of 4.93 means that, on average, the predictions made by your linear regression model are off by about $4,930. This metric is in the same units as the target variable (the median home value), making it easier to interpret compared to MSE.
Overall Interpretation
Model Performance:

An RMSE of approximately $4,930 indicates a reasonable level of accuracy for this model. Depending on the context of the Boston Housing dataset, this might be acceptable, especially considering the variability in housing prices.
Practical Implications:

If you're using this model to inform decisions or predictions about housing prices, you can expect your predictions to typically be within $4,930 of the actual median values. This could help stakeholders make informed decisions about property investments or pricing.
Next Steps:

To improve the model further, you could explore feature engineering, using regularization techniques (like Ridge or Lasso regression), or even trying other algorithms (like Decision Trees or Random Forests) to see if they yield better predictions.

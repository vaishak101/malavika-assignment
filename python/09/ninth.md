Step 6: Insights and Patterns
After visualizing the data, discuss any interesting patterns or insights:

Distribution of Alcohol Content: If the histogram shows a skewed distribution, you might note that wines tend to have a higher concentration of alcohol content in a certain range.

Quality vs. Alcohol: The boxplot may reveal that higher quality wines tend to have higher alcohol content, suggesting a potential relationship between these variables.

Correlation Insights: The correlation heatmap might show strong positive or negative correlations between various features (e.g., acidity and quality), which can help in understanding the key factors influencing wine quality.
